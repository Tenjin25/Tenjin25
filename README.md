# Hi, I'm Shamar Davis 👋

🔨 **Background**: Son of a steelworker turned computer programmer  
📊 **Passion**: Political data analysis and electoral trends  
💻 **Focus**: Building tools for real-world political analysis  
🎯 **Current Project**: Targeting 2026 House battlegrounds with data-driven tools

## About Me

I'm a computer programmer with working-class roots and a passion for political data. Coming from a steelworker family, I bring an authentic perspective to analyzing electoral trends, particularly in working-class districts that have experienced significant political realignment.

Currently studying **CPT-236 Computer Programming** and applying those skills to real-world political analysis challenges.

## Featured Work: MarginCalculator

A Java application for analyzing electoral competitiveness - built after dissecting 2020-2024 presidential realignment patterns. This tool serves as the foundation for targeting the 25-30 battleground House seats that will determine control in 2026.

**Key Features:**
- 🗳️ Electoral margin calculation and race rating system
- 📈 Validated against actual 2024 election outcomes
- 🎯 Strategic focus on competitive battleground districts
- 📊 Professional political analysis methodology

**Tech Stack**: Java, Political Analysis, Electoral Data  
**Background**: Working-class perspective meets programming skills  

### Real-World Validation
The MarginCalculator methodology has been validated against actual election outcomes:
- **Pennsylvania U.S. Senate (2024)**: Correctly classified as "Tossup" - went to legal challenges
- **Congressional Districts**: Accurately predicted competitive races in PA-08, CA-45
- **Electoral Trends**: Captures Obama-Trump district realignment patterns

## Current Focus: 2026 Midterm Analysis

After analyzing presidential electoral trends from 2020-2024, I'm building systematic tools for targeting battleground House seats in the 2026 midterms. Rather than attempting to predict all 435 races, the focus is on the 25-30 truly competitive districts that will determine House control.
